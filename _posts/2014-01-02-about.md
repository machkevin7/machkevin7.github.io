## About Me


I am currently an undergraduate senior at UC San Diego and will be graduating June of 2019. I decided to pursue a B.S. in Math-CS because I developed a strong interest in software engineering at an early age and also knew that a strong foundation in math could lend itself to better algorithm development. I have industry experience in Data Science and Analytics and Software Engineering from internship experiences with theDevMasters and Raytheon. Additionally, I am in pursuit of a business minor because I enjoy learning about the finances, marketing, and product management which will hopefully allow me to branch towards product management. I plan on attaining a masters in computer science after a few years in the workforce.
